# Vicsek Model

This repository is dedicated to simulating the Vicsek model. The simulation uses Julia and incorporates the link cell method for efficiency purposes. It is designed to replicate the results of the original [Vicsek paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226).
